1.	pick a class of genes

2.	[
		Before computing the distance among pairs of sequences, align them using global alignment
		(matches should be scored with 1, mismatches with -1, gap with -2).
		The observed differences (equal weight of mismatches, insertions, and deletions) in sequence
		should be then corrected using the Jukes-Cantor model to obtain an evolutionary distance.
	]

	Align each one of them with all the others,
	resulting in a distance matrix, like:

		A B C D
	  A 0 1 2 3
	  B   0 3 4
	  C     0 6
	  D       0

3.	use junes-canter model or something?? to correct some values 

4.	build a tree with some algorithm

6.	construct some algorith that ranks trees by how well they
	separate the mamals with the fish
	
5.	see which class of genes builds the best tree
