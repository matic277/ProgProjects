-1,13-05-2021,After several big pharma shills called me "anti-vax" and "conspiracy theorist" today, let me get one thing straight: I'm not anti-vax. I'm vaccinated against several diseases. However, experimental vaccines should be 100% voluntary and not be injected into children - period! 0x1f64f 0x1f3fb
-1,13-05-2021,The vaccines should not have been rolled out. You cannot grant emergency use only licenses if effective treatments exist. The fact that they deliberately suppressed several effective treatments prior to issuing those licenses means they broke the law and should be held to account
1,13-05-2021,If you're vaccinated, you can *still* get Covid, just like you can still get a mild flu if you have the flu vaccine. #WearYourMask if you care about yourself & others.
-1,13-05-2021,@ThePolitiGuy16 @TalibKundalini @BrandonRHaddock @NBCNews @RapSheet Explain to me how u mass produce a 0x201c vaccine 0x201d and announce that everyone still needs to wear masks because it doesn ' t prevent the spread.and then claim that the 0x201c vaccine 0x201d does, in fact, prevent the spread many months later. Did they change the 0x201c vaccine 0x201d formulation?
1,13-05-2021,I don't think people understand how dangerous to a society vaccine passports are. You split society in two. You can't maintain a relationship with someone who declares they should have access to, eg, a museum, but you & your family shouldn't. You'll soon have parallel societies.

-1,13-05-2021,@ufollow_me_now5 Yes. But my understanding is that these vaccines are so good you are very unlikely to get covid and if you do get it, it's mild. And it's harder to spread covid when you are vaxxed. If ask that is true (which is only my understanding of it) then let's do normal things again!
-1,13-05-2021,@ryanhanrahan My fear is that this is going to lead to another jump in cases by people unwilling to get the vaccine but also feel totally confident to not wear a mask, which can lead to more variants.

-1,13-05-2021,If the vaccinated can remove their masks (around anyone) because they are protected (true), and if vaccines are readily available to anyone who wants one (also true, except for children), it should follow immediately that actually everyone can remove their masks. https://t.co/n1rNZAVzvF

-1,13-05-2021,@SheetalJaitly They probably aught to add that it takes 4 weeks to hit full efficacy lest the US descends into another stupid debate over whether vaccines work because some moron dived into a sea of COVID 20 minutes after receiving shot #2.

-1,13-05-2021,"But how do you know who is vaccinated and who isn't?" Hey stupid, they're telling YOU how YOU should act if you're vaccinated. Also newsflash, the vaccine protects you against unvaccinated people who are unmasked. IT'S A VACCINE.
-1,13-05-2021,@RyneIsMean But without a proof of vaccines, how are businesses and other spaces supposed to implement policies requiring masks for non vaxxed and no masks for vaxxed? Seems premature to announce this with no plan on how to differentiate the two. Puts businesses in tough position.

-1,13-05-2021,Nope. Y ' all better continue to wear those face masks. Telling people if they ' re fully vaccinated they no longer need to wear masks and or distance is just going to cause another wave. The vaccine doesn ' t mean you can ' t still get covid and spread it to others.

-1,13-05-2021,@DrEricDing Presumably logic is we've reached the point where there's widespread vaccine availability so we need to shift policy.

-1,13-05-2021,Instead of cutting 500 trees, how about we compel all malls to offer their parking lots and spaces as vaccination sites? People already know how to get to these places. We have enough malls and, obviously, not enough trees.

-1,13-05-2021,@Lady_Historian We also don't know yet if you can still spread the disease even if you've been vaccinated or how long the vaccine's effectiveness lasts. And since about a quarter of the population thinks medicine is witchcraft and wants to use leeches instead, yeah, I'm gonna keep masking up.
0,13-05-2021,Thank you, President Trump, for delivering to the world two Covid vaccines in record time -- with a third nearly ready -- before you left office. You did all this despite @JoeBiden mocking your vaccine timeline -- and @KamalaHarris sowing anti-vaccination hysteria. https://t.co/q2jof5yhfT

-1,13-05-2021,Fauci helped to fund the COVID-19 virus in China. Then he coordinated the PR campaign about COVID-19 with China. Then he suppressed the use of therapeutics in favor of experimental vaccines because he personally makes money from the vaccines. Criminal.

1,13-05-2021,@WajahatAli This is what is so frustrating me! What is the guidance for those of us who are immune compromised? How effective/protective is the vaccine for those of us that are in that category? My best wishes for your daughter.

0,13-05-2021,Thank you President Biden for aggressively spearheading the vaccine rollout, which has allowed the CDC to end masks for all fully vaccinated people!
-1,13-05-2021,Science tells us that vaccines are never 100% effective. Science tells us not enough are vaccinated yet to achieve herd immunity. Science tells us masks decrease spread. Use your best judgement.

1,13-05-2021,@mdnij34 Yes, I cannot express the sense of relief I have since getting the vaccine.
-1,13-05-2021,obviously the real reason everyone has to keep wearing masks after vaccination is because otherwise it's impossible to maintain the social norm of masking, since you have no idea who is and is not vaccinated at a glance it's weird no one will say this
-1,13-05-2021,@freedompimp2012 Same, vaccine uptake here is relatively high (over 50%) and it's probably much higher in my immediate vicinity. again though absolutely no shame for anybody who disagrees with this or doesn't trust it. I understand exactly where they're coming from.
-1,13-05-2021,Today, an independent advisory committee to the CDC voted to recommend the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for adolescents 12 and older. It ' s one more giant step in our fight against the pandemic.
-1,13-05-2021,Confirmed: the CDC will ease mask guidance for *fully vaccinated* people today, saying they can ditch a mask in most (but not all) instances as evidence mounts that vaccines are working and vaccinated people are proving very unlikely to transmit the virus.
-1,13-05-2021,@Dave0fReckoning I had the same thought. I'm going to carry around my vaccination card to prove I've actually been vaccinated. If enough of us do that proactively maybe we can make it a norm.
0,13-05-2021,how funny would it be if the anti vax people start wearing masks just to prove that they didn ' t get the vaccine
1,13-05-2021,@leahmadelineb I mean.I get it, but that's why people should protect themselves with the vaxx. I'm not worried about maskless people because I'm fully vaccinated.

-1,13-05-2021,@niroads @gerrylynch As ever, there's no absolute answer to that. Does it matter *as much* with the vaccines? No. Does it matter *at all*? Yes, primarily in the sense that there are still vulnerable people (often who won't know it) unvaccinated.

-1,13-05-2021,Graphic says "could become available". Tweet says "will be manufactured". Considering this includes vaccines that are have not even completed trials anywhere in the world (Bio E, Genova, BB Nasal, Zydus), the "could become available" itself is a very optimistic projection.

-1,13-05-2021,Concerned about enactments undoing pandemic as if all over. It is not, at least not yet. CDC acting on masks in a society where 1) willingness to act on behalf of others (low capacity for identification) was nil & 2) reliance solely on vaccine, as a magical object,is uncalled for

-1,13-05-2021,obviously the real reason everyone has to keep wearing masks after vaccination is because otherwise it's impossible to maintain the social norm of masking, since you have no idea who is and is not vaccinated at a glance it's weird no one will say this

0,13-05-2021,CDC is correct that vaccination is extremely effective, and vaccinated can resume all normal activities. But logically that also means unvaccinated can as well, if they accept the virus risk. There is no society-wide risk at this point so no justification for restrictions.

By fall they will have been away from friends and teachers for a year and a half, and now I get to play anxiety whack-a-mole of 0x201c who ' s vaccinated and who ' s just an asshole 0x201d every time we go anywhere until vaccines are approved for them.
